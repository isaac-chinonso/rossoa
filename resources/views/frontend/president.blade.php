                        <p style="text-align: justify;">It gives me great joy and honour to welcome you to the official website of Remo Secondary School Old Students Association. This website was designed to facilitate active participation and growth of the association across the globe.
                            Remo Secondary School Old Students Association was birthed from Remo Secondary School (First Co-educational Secondary School in West Africa), and borne out of a strategic vision to unite all old students for the development of the school community. The primary focus is to build a unified force for the development of our Alma Mater, individual growth, as well as the fulfillment of the students that pass through the formative environment of the school.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">This website constitutes a part of the Association´s Master plan to properly and strategically grow the association home and abroad. The website provides certain functionalities that allow members to be actively involved in the affairs of the association from different parts of the world. I am glad to reveal that all registered members of the association can now pay their dues, make donations, chat with their class sets on specific forums and vote at the national and class levels and many more on the RSSOSA website. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that the website will play a pivotal role in achieving the aims and objectives of the association. Some of which are;</p>

                        <li>To promote the spirit of fellowship, mutual love, and cooperation among all members.</li>
                        <li>To maintain and enhance the prestige and good name of the Alma Mater.</li>
                        <li>To support the Alma Mater by way of donations, cash and kit so as to accelerate the academic and social progress of the school. </li>
                        <li>To provide a forum for skills development and job opportunities for current students and the alumni.</li>
                        <li>Create events and gatherings that will foster and strengthen the communal bond between all alumni members.</li>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">All these are geared towards the fulfillment of the vision and mission of RSS, our alma mater. We have come a long way in the history of Remo Secondary School, and I can confidently say that it is time to unravel the best of the past, present and future of our Alma Mater. Our goal is to give back to the school academically, financially and structurally, and we are not backing down. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">I sincerely wish to express my appreciation to everyone who was instrumental in making this website project a reality, special gratitude to the ever active RSSOSA Executive Committee for your continued support and hard work.<br> May Almighty God continue to bless the work of our hands.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Once again I say ̎Welcome aboard our digital home̎. I appeal to every member of this great association to fully utilize the website in all its individual functionalities and join me on the journey to digitalize RSSOSA. This is the beginning of greater things to come for Remo Secondary School Old Students Association.<br>Thank you.</p>
